# Overview

In the move toward big data applications there are many activities focused on the structure, presentation, and annotation all kinds of data. Central though to all these efforts is the need to report a unit with any measured value. Currently, there are a number of disparate activities focused around the digital representation of units because of the urgent need to definitively represent and refer to scientific units, quantities and dimensions in the digital space. Interoperability is significantly hampered in the current, fragmented digital unit landscape. This project is focused on development of a site dedicated to the interoperability, usage and documentation of unit representations.

## Features

* Provide a stable, authoritative source for scientific units for digital applications
* Allow international units-related bodies to facilitate the process of digital unit development
* Codify, through ontologies, vocabularies and naming conventions unit and quantity representations
* Promote systematic unit/quantity application and usage through best practices and use cases
* Allow international standards agencies to provide formal language translations of units
* Provide a mechanism whereby legacy units can be represented and related to current units
* Produce a global network of synchronized unit repositories
