Item No.: 9-1
Quantity: number of entities
Symbol: N_X
Defn: number of elementary entities of kind X in a system
Unit: 1
Remarks: The elementary entities must be specified and can be atoms, molecules, ions, electrons, other particle, or a specified group of such particles. It is important to always give a precise specification of the entity involved; this should preferably be done by the empirical chemical formula of the material involved.


9-2,amount of substance (DEPRECATED: number of moles),n(X),quotient of number N of specified elementary entities of kind X (item 9-1) in a sample, and the Avogadro constant N_A (ISO 80000-1): n(X) = N(X)/N_A,mol
Amount of substance is one of the seven base quantities in the International System of Quantities, ISQ (see ISO 80000-1). Elementary entities, such as molecules, atoms, ions, electrons, holes and other quasi-particles, double bonds can be used. It is necessary to specify precisely the entity involved, e.g. atoms of hydrogen H vs. molecules of hydrogen H2, preferably by giving the molecular chemical formula of the material involved. In the name “amount of substance”, the words “of substance” could be replaced by words specifying the substance concerned, e.g. “amount of hydrogen chloride, HCl”, or “amount of benzene, C6H6”. The name “number of moles” is often used for “amount of substance”, but this is deprecated because the name of a quantity should be distinguished from the name of the unit.

9-3	relative atomic mass	mml_m14	quotient of the average mass (ISO 80000-4) of atom X and the unified atomic mass (ISO 80000-10)	1	A similar quantity “relative molecular mass” can be defined for molecules.
EXAMPLE

mml_m16
The relative atomic or relative molecular mass depends on the nuclidic composition.
The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) accepts the use of the special names “atomic weight” and “molecular weight” for the quantities “relative atomic mass” and “relative molecular mass”, respectively. The use of these traditional names is deprecated.

    mml_m30
	mol/l
mol m–3
	In chemistry, the name “amount-of-substance concentration” is generally abbreviated to the single word “concentration”, it being assumed that the adjective “amount-of-substance” is intended. For this reason, however, the word “mass” should never be omitted from the name “mass concentration” in item 9-10.

	1	For condensed phases, xX is used, and for gaseous mixtures yX may be used.
