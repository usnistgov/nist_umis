A measurement is made of the intensity of light transmitted through the dust spot formed relative to that transmitted through an identical clean filter. The dirtiness of the air is reported in terms of the COH unit. This relates to the quantity of particulate material which produces an optical density, log 10 ( I 0 I ) and relative to the transmission of an identical dust-free filter taken as 100%. Thus a filter which transmitted 50% relative to the clean filter has an absorbance of 0.301 or 30.1 COH units. This is not a recommended measure of filterable particulate matter since the size, colour and other properties of the aerosol and the air in which it is suspended affect the results."
